
This code features a "for loop," a type of loop capable of repeating an action a specified number of times. This specific loop prints a variable to the console; the variable starts at 1, and with each step multiplies it by 2 and added to by 1 (resulting in a sequence of 1, 3, 7, 15, and so on). This continues until the variable exceeds 5000, at which point the program shuts off. Interestingly, this series always remains one below each power of two (2, 4, 8, 16, and so on). Since methods of binary storage are always capped at one less than a power of two, this could be counting up different binary storage maximums; for instance, a byte stores numbers between 0 and 7. However, I am not aware of any name corresponding to the range 0-3 (or two binary bits), so this is likely to merely be reflecting the mathematical series 2‚Åø and not any particular real-world phenomena.
